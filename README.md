# AI-Maze-Game
An AI maze game in which the user controls a sprite through a maze while avoiding and fighting enemies.

## **Motivation**
The motivation was to create a program which made use of sprites and other PNG assets and more importantly 
used the A* algorithm.

## **Tech/Frameworks Used**
The Depth-First Search algorithm was used to generate the maze. The Random Walk algorithm was used
to control the movement of enemies. The A* algorithm was used to find the exit to the maze.

## **How To Use**
The user can simply use this program through a Java IDE such as Eclipse.
Simply 'run' the program and the GUI will be generated.
